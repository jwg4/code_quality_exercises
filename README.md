# code_quality_exercises
A new exercise in code style, reviewing, editing, and quality control each week.

Solutions are suggestions only.

## Introduction

Testing and code quality, like coding itself, require directed practise to get better.

Most of the code samples are in Python, with a few other languages. Reading code in non-core languages is an important skill for code quality.
