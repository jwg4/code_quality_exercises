# code_quality_exercises
A new exercise in code style, reviewing, editing, and quality control each week.

Solutions are suggestions only.

## Week 1.

Add comments to the code in exercises/week_001/countdown.py

## Week 2.

Re-format and clean up the function in exercises/week_002/haiku.py

## Week 3.

Write tests for code which solves the problem in exercises/week_003/brackets.md
Your test code should specify an interface for the implementation (not just a list of passing and failing cases), and should have test cases split into four groups:
- A couple of basic test cases
- Straightforward examples of strings with matching brackets
- Straightforward examples of strings with non-matching brackets
- Potentially tricky cases

## Week 4.

Work on the SQL query in exercises/week_004/nonmatching.sql
- Comment it
- Reformat it
- Improve it

## Week 5.

Improve the function parseGAAP, without changing what it does (you may change behavior which is clearly buggy).
