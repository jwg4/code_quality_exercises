# Week 3.

Write tests for code which solves the problem in `brackets.md`
Your test code should specify an interface for the implementation (not just a list of passing and failing cases), and should have test cases split into four groups:
- A couple of basic test cases
- Straightforward examples of strings with matching brackets
- Straightforward examples of strings with non-matching brackets
- Potentially tricky cases
